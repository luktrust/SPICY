        As companies continue to seek growth in developed 
        and rapid growth markets, challenges clearly remain. 
        There is an increasing need to continue keeping a close
         eye on costs and carefully manage cash flow. Our Accounting
          & Assurance practice assists businesses in addressing
           the strategic accounting and financial reporting challenges 
           facing their businesses and the finance function. Our 
           professionals are not only deeply versed in technical
            accounting, but can provide 
        practical, business-focused advice to leading organisations.<br>
        <br>
        Our audit professionals operate on a risk-based model that
         aligns to a specific understanding of the client’s business,
          industry, and internal controls. We actively communicate
           findings and provide
         knowledge-based insights throughout our assurance engagements.<br>
         <br>
         Our audit approach can be tailored to meet the needs of any 
         size organization, as evidenced by our appointment as auditor
          to some of the largest companies as well as to thousands of 
          small and mid-sized businesses. In every case, a SPC audit
           is underpinned by our deep industry knowledge, wide
            international experience, global network of skilled 
            professionals and our commitment to delivering quality 
            services. This deep 
         industry knowledge is one of the foundations of our success.<br>
         <br>
         Our teams are aligned to industry groupings in which they 
         have the most expertise, enabling them to deliver tailored 
         solutions to complex issues in these sectors. Our traditional 
         core competency has been augmented over the years by development
          of additional services that address our clients’ requirements.
           Our audit clients include many of the top performing companies
            on the Nigeria Securities Exchange, as well as many small 
            and mid-sized businesses. In addition to audit services,
             we also provide
          accounting regulatory advice and assurance related service.
